DESCRIPTION
    This module enables you to specify command line options for setting
    attributes in a Moose class by writing them as POD within your class.
    You can then be assured that your documentation and options available
    are always in sync.

METHODS
  init_meta
    Automatically called when you "use Getopt::Proclus;". Moosifies the
    class and then reads its POD for options to parse from the command line,
    returning the modified metaclass.
