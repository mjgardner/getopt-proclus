Getopt::Euclid version 0.2.0

       Getopt::Euclid uses your program's own documentation to create a com-
       mand-line argument parser. This ensures that your program's documented
       interface and its actual interface always agree.

       To use the module, you simply write:

           use Getopt::Euclid;

       at the top of your program.

       When the module is loaded within a regular Perl program, it will:

            1.  locate any POD in the same file,
            2.  extract information from that POD, most especially
                from the "=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS" and "=head1
                OPTIONS" sections,
            3.  build a parser that parses the arguments and options the
                POD specifies,
            4.  parse the contents of @ARGV using that parser, and
            5.  put the results in the global %ARGV variable.
